# Supply Chain Compliance

- Supply chain security extends beyond internal threat modeling - it ensures every external dependency (libraries, container images, third-party APIs) is verified, tamper-free and complaint.

## Core Aread of Supply Chain Security

| Core Area | Description | Tool / Standard | 
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Artifacts | Build outputs: images, binaries | Sigstore Cosign | 
| Metadata | Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) | SPDX | 
| Attestations | Signed provenance statements | in-toto | 
| Policies | Automated compliance enforcement | Sigstore Policy Controller |

### 1. Artifacts: Signing and Verification
- Artifacts - container images, binaries, and libraries must be signed to prove integrity and origin.
- Sigstoreâ€™s [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/) offers a simple, keyless workflow for signing container images.
- To sign an image:
```bash
cosign sign $IMAGE

#Sample output:
Generating ephemeral keys...
Retrieving signed certificate...
By typing 'y', you attest that you have permission to grant signing.
Are you sure you would like to continue? [y/N] y
Successfully verified SCT...
tlog entry created with index: 12086900
Pushing signature to: $IMAGE
```

- To verify a binary or image:
```bash
cosign verify-blob "$BINARY" \
  --signature "$BINARY.sig" \
  --certificate "$BINARY.cert" \
  --certificate-identity krel-staging@k8s-releng-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://accounts.google.com
```


### 2. Metadata: Generating and Validating SBOMs
- A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is an **ingredients list** for your application, detailing file checksums, licenses, and origins.
- An SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) is often authored in [SPDX](https://spdx.org/) format. It tracks every component and its license.
- Example SPDX excerpt:
```bash
FileName: bin/linux/amd64/kube-controller-manager
SPDXID: SPDXRef-File-kube-controller-manager-v1.31.2
FileChecksum: SHA1: c5e8da214abd18e96aabe7d1bab6addf76455
FileChecksum: SHA256: b16b6becee2bc76af97384ca611d8e972aa7ed213ea75255
LicenseConcluded: Apache-2.0
```

- Retrieve and verify the Kubernetes SBOM:
```bash
# 1. Get the latest stable release
VERSION=$(curl -Ls https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)

# 2. Download SBOM and checksum
curl -Ls "https://sbom.k8s.io/$VERSION/release" -o "$VERSION.spdx"
echo "$(curl -Ls "https://sbom.k8s.io/$VERSION/release.sha512")  $VERSION.spdx" | sha512sum --check

# 3. Fetch Sigstore signature and certificate
curl -Ls "https://sbom.k8s.io/$VERSION/release.sig"  -o "$VERSION.spdx.sig"
curl -Ls "https://sbom.k8s.io/$VERSION/release.cert" -o "$VERSION.spdx.cert"

# 4. Verify SBOM integrity
cosign verify-blob \
  --certificate "$VERSION.spdx.cert" \
  --signature   "$VERSION.spdx.sig" \
  --certificate-identity krel-staging@k8s-releng-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer  https://accounts.google.com \
  "$VERSION.spdx"
```

### 3. Attestations: Building a Chain of Trust
- Attestations are cryptographic statements that vouch for metadata such as provenance, SBOM authenticity, or vulnerability scans.
- Sign an SBOM attestation:
```bash
cosign sign --key <PRIVATE_KEY> sbom.k8s.io/v1.27.4/release.spdx > sbom.attestation
```
- Verify the attestation:
```bash
cosign verify-attestation \
  --key <PUBLIC_KEY> \
  --certificate-identity krel-staging@k8s-releng-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://accounts.google.com \
  sbom.k8s.io/v1.27.4/release.spdx
```

- [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/) defines and verifies attestations across your entire pipeline. Sample step definition:
```bash
- name: build
  expected_command:
    - "make"
  pubkeys: ["developer"]
  expected_materials:
    - "MATCH repo/* WITH REPO"
  expected_products:
    - "CREATE binary"
```

### 4. Policies: Automated Compliance Enforcement
- Policies block deployments of unsigned or non-compliant artifacts. 
- A `ClusterImagePolicy` example:
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: secure-image-policy
spec:
  images:
    - glob: "gcr.io/my-organization/*"
  authorities:
    - key:
        data: |
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
  attestations:
    - name: sbom-check
      predicateType: https://in-toto.io/Statement/v0.1
    - name: vulnerability-check
      predicateType: https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2
  policy:
    validate:
      all:
        - name: sbom-validation
          match:
            attestation-name: sbom-check
        - name: vulnerability-validation
          match:
            attestation-name: vulnerability-check
        - name: signing-validation
          match:
            signed: true
```
- Enforce policies at admission time with Sigstoreâ€™s Policy Controller.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
Key components of Supply Chain Security
- **Artifact**: The binaries and container images are signed using Cosign
- **Metadata**: The SBOM details all the components and their origins, helping you identify risks
- **Attestations**: the SBOM and other metadata are signed to ensure trustworthiness
- **Policies**: Finally admission controllers verify these signatures and enfore compliance before deployment
