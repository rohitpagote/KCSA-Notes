# Compliance Frameworks

- Security compliance frameworks are essential for safeguarding sensitive data such as - personal information, health records, payment details, etc.
- Ignoring these guidelines can lead to data breaches, heavy fines, and loss of customer trust.

## High level comparison of the frameworks

| Framework	| Scope | Key Requirements |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| GDPR	    | EU personal data protection | Encrypt data at rest, restrict data access |
| HIPAA	    | US healthcare PHI | TLS encryption, strict access controls, secure secrets |
| PCI DSS   | Payment card data | Encrypt in transit & at rest, auditing, strong auth |
| NIST      | Cybersecurity best practices | Risk assessments, security controls, periodic audits | 
| CIS Benchmarks | IT system hardening | Secure configs, RBAC, network policies, logging |

### [GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)](https://gdpr.eu/)
- The GDPR is an EU regulation that protects individualsâ€™ personal data and privacy rights.
- In a web application context, GDPR compliance often includes:
    - Encrypting user data stored in your MySQL database (data at rest)
    - Ensuring only authorized back-end services can access personal data

### [HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/)
- HIPAA is a U.S. regulation focused on protecting sensitive patient health information (PHI). 
- For applications handling patient data, must:
    - Encrypt all data transfers (front-end â†” back-end â†” database) using TLS
    - Implement strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access
    - Securely configure Kubernetes Secrets for application use

### [PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/)
- The PCI DSS applies to any system processing payment card data. 
- Key requirements include:
    - Encrypting cardholder data in transit and at rest
    - Enforcing strong access controls
    - Monitoring and auditing all access to payment information

### [NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)
- NIST publishes the Cybersecurity Framework to improve the security and resilience of information systems. 
- For web applications, typical NIST controls involve:
    - Conducting regular risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities
    - Implementing security controls (firewalls, IDS/IPS)
    - Performing periodic security audits

### [CIS Benchmarks (Center for Internet Security)](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/)
- CIS provides detailed benchmarks for securing IT systems, including **Kubernetes**. 
- These guidelines cover:
    - Secure configuration of control plane components (API server, etcd, kubelet, controller-manager, scheduler)
    - Authentication and authorization (enforce RBAC, disable anonymous access)
    - Logging, monitoring, network policies, and pod security
- Tools like Aqua Securityâ€™s **kube-bench** automate verification of these benchmarks.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
- Compliance frameworks guide data protection, encryption, and access controls.
- GDPR targets personla data of EU citizens.
- HIPPA safeguards protected health information (PHI).
- PCI DSS secures payment card data.
- NIST offers risk assessment and security control guidelines.
- CIS Benchmarks provide granular, automated checks for Kubernetes security.
