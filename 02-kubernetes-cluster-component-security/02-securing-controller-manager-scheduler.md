# Securing Controller Manager and Scheduler

In this guide, we detail security best practices for hardening the Kubernetes Controller Manager and Scheduler.

# üõ°Ô∏è Controller Manager and Scheduler Roles
- **Controller Manager**: 
    - Monitors node and pod health
    - Maintains the desired number of pod replicas
    - Manages service accounts via controllers (e.g., ReplicationController, EndpointController, NamespaceController, ServiceAccountController)
- **Scheduler**: 
    - Assigns Pods to Nodes based on resources and policies.

## 1. Isolation on Dedicated Nodes
- Running the Controller Manager and Scheduler on isolated master nodes prevents compromised application pods from reaching critical control-plane components.
    - Dedicate nodes exclusively for control-plane services
    - Taint master nodes to avoid scheduling regular workloads
    - Monitor and patch these nodes independently

## 2. RBAC with Least Privilege

| Component           | Allowed Actions                          | Denied Actions                   |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Controller Manager  | Manage ReplicaSets, Endpoints, Services  | Secrets, NetworkPolicies         |
| Scheduler           | List/watch Pods, Nodes, Bindings         | Creating Roles, etcd access      | 


## 3. Encrypting Communications with TLS
- Encrypt communication between API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, etcd.
- Use mTLS with a trusted CA, automate certificate renewal.
- Monitor cert expirations to avoid outages.

## 4. Audit Logging
- Enable detailed logs for API interactions.
- Capture who changed what, via which component (e.g., ReplicaSet updates).
- Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana for alerting.

# ‚úÖ Summary
1. Isolate Controller Manager and Scheduler on dedicated, tainted nodes
2. Enforce RBAC with least privilege.  
3. Encrypt all control-plane communication (TLS/mTLS).  
4. Enable and monitor audit logs.  
5. Secure kubeconfig, default configs; rotate certs.  
6. Keep components up to date and scan for vulnerabilities.
